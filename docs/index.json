All the sources that failed to keep my data private are services I don’t even use anymore. Now you could argue why I didn’t delete these accounts after I stopped using them, and you would be right. I have to blame myself as well. However, as I looked into my password manager and saw I amassed over 150 accounts over the years.

If it comes back, it’s yours. If not, it was never meant to be. Some services understood this and made it as simple to delete your account as it is to sign up for a new one.

Now, I know from the times I had to use this myself that it can still be a burdensome process. Thomas Landauer probably had the same impression, which is why he created Online-Kündigen.at.

What sparked my interest is section 1.d), which states that you are allowed to know: “…where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;” To which you’ll most likely get the answer: “We will store your data until further notice.” But what if I am no longer able to give that notice?

Instead of the right to be forgotten, I would like to flip the responsibility of deleting unused data and make it a duty to forget. If you’re a Software Developer yourself, you can probably imagine how hard it will be to convince your product managers to implement a feature that automatically deletes inactive accounts. Still, I think there are good reasons to do it before it is enforced by law (which it hopefully will be someday). First, let me explain what exactly I imagine this feature to be. ","date":"2023-08-25","objectID":"/the-duty-to-forget/:2:0","tags":null,"title":"The duty to forget","uri":"/the-duty-to-forget/"},{"categories":null,"content":"As a user, I want to be forgotten so I can have peace of mind. I have been in more than one meeting where a lengthy discussion was ended by simply pointing out that “We are not like Google.” This revelation is probably not a hard pill to swallow for most software developers out there. Yet, it should not prevent us from observing how tech giants operate and learn from them. After all, there is a reason they’re giants. They might have done some things right up until now. So here is how Google handles deleting inactive accounts. There is a menu in the account settings called Inactive Account Manager. Here you can decide after how many months your account should be treated as inactive. This means if you didn’t use any of their services for the set period, you will get notified that your account will be marked as inactive. At this point, a person you appointed can take over the control of your account or download a copy of your data. If this person does not respond or you did not designate someone, your data will be deleted after another 3 months. Screenshot of the inactive account management settings page Transferring the ownership of a user’s data goes beyond just being forgotten and rather represents something like a digital last will. However, the inactivity and deletion part should be relatively simple to implement on its own. Adding two timestamps (LAST_ACTIVE_AT and DELETE_BY) in the user database and a cron job to set and act on them should do the trick. Yes, I glossed over the deleteUser() process itself, which ‒ depending on how micro distributed the underlying services are ‒ might be a bit trickier. I argue, though, that this function should already be in place since any kind of service should allow its users to trigger it themselves anyway. Trust me when I tell you that you really want to automate the deletion of users. This is coming from someone who had to answer Article 17 requests (see above) by manually dropping the right rows of the production database. It’s a nightmare nobody should have to go through.

After all, the user value behind this feature is quite vague. What is hopefully a bit easier to comprehend is the amount of money the IT department spends on infrastructure (should this not be the case in your company, think about changing your hosting provider). It should be evident to everyone that an ever-growing amount of data can only lead to an ever-growing cost for storage (independent if it is self-hosted or not). Furthermore, an ever-growing index in a database means a steady decline in query performance which impacts all users. Both examples’ effect is “just” logarithmic, but the trend is still in the wrong direction. In German, there is a word for inactive members. They’re called Karteileiche, literally meaning a corpse in the register. So if you want to sell this to your product manager, tell them you want to eliminate all those zombies slowing down your service.

It also triggered me that the password is my 8-digit account number, which I can’t change, so please don’t hack me.

This was entirely on-brand for an organization of their age, but the promptness of the response made me wonder how often they get requests like mine.

This is from a time when Austria still had a different data protection act (the DSG 2000), but the fundamentals were pretty close to the GDPR. The issue here is that two constitutionally protected rights are at odds here. The right to be forgotten and the right of the church not to have its internal affairs influenced by the state. The church keeps parish registers to record anyone who ever received a sacrament. Since, according to their rules, you can only get baptized once, they need to keep track of you. Even if you decide to leave, they want to keep you as a member in spirit, should you ever change your mind and want to have a church wedding or any other sacrament. In the end, the court ruled in favor of the church, arguing that the DSG 2000 does not intend to eradicate collective memories of society, and removing someone from the parish registers would come close to that. You could use the same argument to allow Blizzard to save your World of Warcraft account indefinitely because someone might want to marry your Draenei paladin in the future.

There are some products of kiweno now where your biological gender is required to get a better result. However, the actual explanation as to why this is already asked at signup is (as so often in software) for legacy reasons. In the beginning, the assumption was to require this information to correctly address people in e-mails and other form of communication.
