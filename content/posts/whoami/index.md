## Let me introduce myself

As you might have read in the title and the domain name, my name is Andreas and I am working as a software developer.
To share a bit about me, here are a few of my personal preferences:
- Starter pok√©mon: [Charmander](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Charmander)
- Linux distro: [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
- Desktop environment: [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/)
- Shell: [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) always extended with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- Coffee: [Americano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Americano) 
- Color theme: [Atom One Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-theme-onedark)
- IDE: [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

## Frontend or backend developer?
Yes! :smiling_face:

In the past, I had the opportunity to work on projects where I was involved in all layers of the stack. From the sizing of the servers up to the spacing of buttons. My ultimate goal would be to become a holistic developer, someone who is knowledgeable about all aspects of software development. Think BizDevSecOps+.

The platform I like to develop for mostly is the browser (of course some more than others).
Although I can justifiably call myself a [Rockstar developer](https://github.com/holistic-developer/shout-it-out-loud) the main languages I work in are Typescript and Java.

I am someone who is easy to get excited about the next cool thing in tech, but I am not blindly jumping on every hype train. We should always try to understand the core problem that needs to be solved, or if there even is a real problem, to begin with.

Sometimes seemingly minor tech decisions can have major implications on the products we build, which is why my favorite interview question is: *"What do you consider when choosing a new library or dependency"*.

Independent of the tools or the project I work on, I try to apply Robert C. Martin's variation of the Boy Scout rule:
**"Always leave the code cleaner than you found it."**
